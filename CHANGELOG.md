## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added
- `/kas:verify` - Orchestrator command that runs code review and reality assessment in parallel
- `/kas:review-code` - Standalone code quality review (Linus Torvalds style)
- `/kas:review-reality` - Standalone reality assessment (skeptical validation)

### Changed
- Commands are now composable: `/kas:verify` uses Task agents to run the standalone commands in parallel

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-09

### Fixed
- **task-splitter auto-trigger**: Now chains from plan-reviewer output, ensuring it runs before ExitPlanMode
- **plan-reviewer → task-splitter flow**: Added explicit "Next Step" in plan-reviewer output
- **SessionStart hook error**: Made ensure-daemon.sh silent and always exit 0
- **Post-approval workflow**: Stops after beads creation, provides next session prompt for context clearing

### Changed
- task-splitter now runs BEFORE ExitPlanMode (alongside plan-reviewer) instead of after approval
- Implementation must start in fresh context after `/clear`
