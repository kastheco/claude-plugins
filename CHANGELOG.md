  - `clickup-task-agent` for MCP delegation (keeps main context clean)
  - `task-workflow` skill with setup, prompts, and templates

### Added
- `/kas:start` - Structured planning workflow with beads integration
  - Checks beads context before planning
  - Enforces explore → design → review workflow
  - Auto-runs plan-reviewer and task-splitter before ExitPlanMode
  - Integration contract for 3rd party skills

### Fixed
- `/kas:verify` now runs reality assessment on non-code changes
  - Tier 2 validates plan completion regardless of change type
  - Docs-only and config-only changes are properly verified

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-14

### Changed

  - kas plugin moved to `plugins/kas/` subdirectory
  - marketplace.json updated with subdirectory source path

### Migration
Update your `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "kas@kas-claude-plugins": true
  }
}
```

## [1.6.0] - 2025-01-13

### Added
- `/kas:setup` - Prepare project for kas workflow
  - Validates prerequisites (bd ≥0.5.0, gh authenticated with repo scope, git ≥2.20.0)
  - Detects worktree context and uses parent repo's .beads/
  - Manages daemon with sync-before-change and auto-restart
  - Verifies remote push access and creates util/beads-sync branch
  - Checks if kas plugin is enabled in target project
  - Shows summary with PASS/FAIL/WARN verdict

### Changed
- CLAUDE.md now includes plugin development context section

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added
- `/kas:verify` now integrates pr-review-toolkit agents:
  - silent-failure-hunter, comment-analyzer, type-design-analyzer, pr-test-analyzer (parallel)
  - code-simplifier (runs after VERIFIED verdict)

### Changed
- `/kas:verify` runs 6 agents in parallel instead of 2

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added
- `/kas:verify` - Orchestrator command that runs code review and reality assessment in parallel
- `/kas:review-code` - Standalone code quality review (Linus Torvalds style)
- `/kas:review-reality` - Standalone reality assessment (skeptical validation)

### Changed
- Commands are now composable: `/kas:verify` uses Task agents to run the standalone commands in parallel

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-09

### Fixed
- **task-splitter auto-trigger**: Now chains from plan-reviewer output, ensuring it runs before ExitPlanMode
- **plan-reviewer → task-splitter flow**: Added explicit "Next Step" in plan-reviewer output
- **SessionStart hook error**: Made ensure-daemon.sh silent and always exit 0
- **Post-approval workflow**: Stops after beads creation, provides next session prompt for context clearing

### Changed
- task-splitter now runs BEFORE ExitPlanMode (alongside plan-reviewer) instead of after approval
- Implementation must start in fresh context after `/clear`
